"""Thin Win32 window and control access. No Altium knowledge lives here.

Deliberately small and free of any dialog-specific logic, so it can be
exercised against any window on the machine rather than only against
Altium. What a dialog MEANS is decided in ``dialog_report``, and what to
press about it in ``dialog_driver``.

Two rules the callers depend on:

* Nothing here clicks anything unless asked by an explicit call. There
  is no "find and press" convenience, because the whole risk of this
  package is pressing the wrong thing.
* Matching is by window CLASS and caption together. A caption alone is
  not identifying: Altium reuses captions across dialogs, and other
  applications can hold a window with the same title.
