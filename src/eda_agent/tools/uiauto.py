"""Tools that drive the Altium GUI, for operations with no API.

Altium exposes a great deal only as menus and dialogs, so this is a
general driver rather than a one-off: discover a menu, invoke it, read
whatever dialog it raises, set the controls inside, press a button.

NONE OF IT USES THE BRIDGE. Every tool here talks to Win32 and to the
accessible layer, and only asks the bridge for Altium's process id,
which is a process scan rather than IPC. That is what makes these the
tools that still answer when a modal has the scripting engine blocked,
and it is why invoking a command and driving the dialog it opens can
be a single call: nothing in that sequence needs the bridge to be free.

Everything here presses buttons in a GUI, which is a different kind of
operation from the rest of the surface, and the separate module is so
nobody reaches one by accident while looking for the other.

        THIS PRESSES BUTTONS IN THE GUI. Update From Libraries has no
        API: Altium documents it as a dialog, there is no process that
        launches it, and the operation ends in an Engineering Change
        Order that only a click can execute. So this matches windows
        belonging to the Altium process and presses named buttons on
        them.

        WHAT IT WILL DO AT THE END. The last steps press Validate
        Changes and then EXECUTE CHANGES on the ECO. That applies every
        pending change to the design and is not undoable through this
        channel. Take ``app_checkpoint`` first.

        WHAT IT CANNOT TELL YOU. While the wizard is open Altium's
        script engine is blocked, so the bridge cannot be asked
        anything, and an ECO's pending changes sit in a grid that
        exposes no text to Windows. The reply records the windows and
        buttons seen; it does NOT contain the change list. Read the
        Messages panel afterwards for that.

        NOTHING IS SCRIPTED. There is no list of expected dialogs. Each
        one that appears is read, classified, and answered by the ROLE
        of the buttons it offers, then the screen is read again. That is
        deliberate: a scripted version failed on live Altium because the
        editor legitimately shows dialogs no list contained, and waited
        for a change order that was never coming while an unlisted modal
        blocked the session.

        It STOPS rather than guessing when a dialog reports an error,
        asks a question it was not sent to answer, or offers no button
        whose meaning is recognised.

        RUN IT DRY FIRST, WHICH IS THE DEFAULT. A dry run reads the
        first dialog, reports what it is and what it would press, and
        presses nothing.

        LAUNCHING. ``already_open`` (the default) attaches to a wizard
        you have opened yourself, which avoids depending on a menu path
        nobody has verified. ``menu`` asks the bridge to fire the menu
        first; that request will not return until the wizard closes,
        which is expected and is why it is issued without waiting.

        Args:
            target: ``schematic`` for Tools > Update From Libraries, or
                ``pcb`` for Tools > Update From PCB Libraries.
            launch: ``already_open`` or ``menu``.
            dry_run: report without pressing. Default true.
            confirm_execute_eco: must be true for a real run, and it is
                named for the specific consequence rather than being a
                general "confirm", because the irreversible part is the
                ECO and not the wizard.
            answer_confirmations: answer routine "carry on?" prompts.
                Altium asks "Continue and create ECO?" before every
                change order, so with this off the run stops there and
                can never finish. A confirmation mentioning anything
                irreversible (delete, overwrite, cannot be undone) is
                still left alone whatever this is set to.
            first_step_timeout: seconds to wait for the FIRST dialog to
                appear. Raise it when launching by menu on a large
                project.

        Returns:

        Use this when ``app_run_menu`` will not do, which is more often
        than it looks: that tool reports success for commands it never
        invokes, because the process ids it dispatches cannot report
        failure and some of them are not real (task #83). This one
        clicks the actual menu, so a command either runs or the reply
        says why not.

        PATH BY NAME. ``"Design|Rules..."``, ``"Tools|Update From
        Libraries..."``. Accelerator markers and a trailing ellipsis are
        ignored, so ``"Design|Rules"`` works too. Nested submenus work
        by adding levels. Names are used rather than positions because
        entries move with context and separators are invisible.

        IT NEEDS THE FOREGROUND. Altium has no Win32 menu and its
        DevExpress bars expose no working accessible action, so the only
        thing that opens them is real input: this brings Altium to the

        handle and depends on none of that, which is why this one is
        gated behind ``may_steal_focus`` and never happens by default.

        THE MENU BAR IS PER EDITOR. With a board focused you get the PCB
        menus, with a schematic the schematic ones. Focus the matching
        document first, or the reply will tell you the item was not
        there and list what was.

        THE TOOL TO REACH FOR WHEN THE BRIDGE GOES QUIET. A silent

        compiling, or dead. This answers it directly: ``blocked`` is
        read from the main window being disabled, which is what Windows
        does while a modal is up, and it works precisely when no other
        tool can because it does not use the bridge at all. It reads the
        Win32 process, so a blocked Altium answers it normally.

        FOR EACH DIALOG you get the caption, the message text, every
        button with its enabled state, and a ``kind``:

        * ``error`` / ``warning`` / ``confirm`` -- something went wrong

          Execute.
        * ``wizard`` / ``progress`` / ``unknown``.

        WHAT IT STILL CANNOT READ. Grids and owner-drawn lists hold
        their content internally and expose no window text, so an ECO's
        pending-change list is not readable. That is reported per dialog

        The missing primitive. Dialogs could be listed, read and their
        checkboxes set, but the only code that pressed anything was
        buried inside a single task-specific driver, so answering an
        arbitrary dialog meant writing a script.

        BY CAPTION, not position. Accelerator ampersands and a trailing
        ellipsis are ignored, so "Report Changes" finds
        "&Report Changes...".

        IT WORKS WHILE ALTIUM IS BLOCKED, because it addresses the
        button's window handle over Win32 and never touches the bridge.
        That is the whole point: when a modal has the scripting engine
        stuck, this is what gets it unstuck.

        IRREVERSIBLE PRESSES ARE GATED. A caption that commits a change
        order or applies a wizard is refused unless
        ``allow_irreversible`` is set, so a driver walking an unfamiliar
        dialog cannot execute one by reflex.

        For a whole sequence rather than one press, use
        ``app_drive_dialogs``, which decides each step from what is on
        screen instead of from a script.

        Args:
            button_caption: the visible caption.
            dialog_title: substring picking one dialog when several are
                open. Empty uses the first.
            allow_irreversible: permit a committing press.

        Returns:
            ``ok``, the dialog and button actually matched, and whether
            the dialog closed afterwards.

        a yes/no question that moves an operation along;
        ``allow_commit`` permits the press that changes the design.
        Named for their consequences, because a caller reaching for one
        rarely means the other.

        Args:

        The composite, and usually the one to reach for. Firing a menu
        command that opens a modal blocks Altium's scripting engine, so
        the two halves cannot be separate bridge calls: the second would
        never be answered. Both halves here are Win32, so they run in
        one call and the modal is no obstacle.

        Doing this by hand meant arming a watcher process before firing
        the command, which is not something a caller should have to
        assemble.

        THE GATES ARE THE DIALOG DRIVER'S. ``allow_confirm`` defaults ON
        because a command invoked deliberately usually needs its "yes,
        go ahead" answered, while ``allow_commit`` defaults OFF, so a
        change order is presented rather than executed. ``dry_run``
        defaults OFF here, unlike ``app_drive_dialogs``: naming a
        command to run and having nothing happen is not what the caller
        asked for.

        Args:
