"""A wrong-document refusal must say where the operation DOES live.

"No PCB library is active" is true and unhelpful. It reports what is
missing and not that the same operation exists for the other document
kind, so the reasonable conclusion from it is that the capability is
absent. That conclusion was drawn and reported more than once, and each
time the tool existed under the other namespace.

Measured before the hint was added: 277 document-resolution refusals in
the Pascal, of which 5 named a tool.

The hint is attached in ``BuildErrorResponseDetailed`` rather than at
those 277 sites, so what this guards is the table and the call, not the
wording of each message. A new document-kind code added without a hint
fails here.
